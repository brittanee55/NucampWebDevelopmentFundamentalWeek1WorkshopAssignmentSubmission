<!--
        This is where you will use the MP3 file that you downloaded and added to an mp3s folder as instructed in the "Before Your Workshop" section above. If you skipped this part, go back and follow those instructions now. 
Add an <audio> element on your webpage where you deem appropriate.
The <audio> element works almost exactly like the <video> element.
It supports MP3, OGG, and WAV file formats.
Give it a src attribute with a relative path to your mp3 file.
Also give it a Boolean attribute of controls. You can add loop to it as well, if you wish. 
inside the start and end tags, add this text content, replacing where it says YourAudioFileNameHere with your actual audio file's name:
Your browser does not support HTML5 audio. Here is <a href="mp3s/YourAudioFileNameHere.mp3">a link to the audio</a> instead.
   
Use your judgment to place your other image file(s) in an appropriate place or places within your document. It or they might belong in the first section, the second section, or even a new section.
Use the <a> element to add at least two hyperlinks of your choice. These can be in the form of links to other webpages, a link to another section of the same page, or a link to your phone or email. Two is the minimum; you can add as many as you wish!
Add <em> and/or <strong> elements if appropriate. Use your discretion. If there is not any content that would require these elements, you don't need to add them.
If there is still time left in the workshop, you can add more content to your profile, or try using your profile page to play with a new element that you haven't used yet. See the Assignment Resources below for links to both W3Schools and MDN's HTML element references pages. You won't be graded on this, but it would be a wise use of your time!
